2D GridLSTM

Yesterday we have implemented 2D GridLSTM, now we are dubugging it. Seems the problem is in the gradient calculations. It is exploding


Exp 1 

One layer of LSTM and one layer of gridLSTM 


Exp 2 

Two layers of LSTM and two layers of gridLSTM.
Experiment showed that tying of depth dimension actually doesn't work.

Rewrote gridLSTM in more correct manner and now it works

Tomorrow should write report about my two day experiments. And try to build train_mnist_with nngraph
